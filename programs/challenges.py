# These challenges are intended to provide practice in basic python skills such as string manipulation, iteration, use of collection types and conditionals

# Challenge 1: Write a function which:
# - Takes a string as an argument
# - returns the string in all upper case if its' length is even, and all lower case if its' length is odd. Any non-alphabetic characters should not be changed
# - stretch goal: try to implement this both with and without the .upper()/.lower() methods

def func_1_methods(string):
    pass

def func_1_no_methods(string):
    pass

# Challenge 2: write a function which:
# - takes a word and a list of words as input
# - returns a new list containing only the words from the given list which differ from the given word in exactly one position
# You should ignore case

def func_2(string, list):
    pass
