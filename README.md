# python-challenges
This repo contains a collection of practice problems involving python fundamentals such as string manipulation, iteration, collections and conditionals. The format of these challenges is similar to the format of the python assessments and should help you to prepare for these. This branch has a challenges file (in programs) with working solutions to the exercises.  

The tests folder contains a test file with blank test definitions for you to fill in with your own unit tests. Once you have written your tests:  
* First ensure that pytest and pytest-cov are installed on your system (if they are not, run the following command: pip3 install pytest pytest-cov)
* Make sure that you have saved the test_challenges.py file with your tests in
* Run the tests with the following command: python3 -m pytest --cov=programs
* Try to get your coverage as close to 100% as possible.
