# python-challenges
This repo contains a collection of practice problems involving python fundamentals such as string manipulation, iteration, collections and conditionals. The format of these challenges is similar to the format of the python assessments and should help you to prepare for these. This branch has a challenges file with working solutions to the problems, so that you can follow through the logic to gain an understanding of how to solve the problems.  

The tests folder contains a test file which will check these solutions against some test cases; to see the test results for these solutions:  
* First ensure that pytest is installed on your system (if it is not, run the following command: pip3 install pytest)
* Run the tests with the following command: python3 -m pytest
